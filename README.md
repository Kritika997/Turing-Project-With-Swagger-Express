  SO it is like a amazon online site what ever we are doing in that
  same first creating our account init then saving our password and user name
  with the help of that we can login in it when ever we want and if  
  we want to order something we can and if we want to save it for later that also we can.
  same that we are doing it in our turing task for that I used Swagger terminal
  for running APIs which I created.
